---++ Description

This plugin implements a way to freely specify the title of a topic. The title is then used when rendering the link to
the topic instead of just displaying the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.WikiWord]] that represents a topic. So let's recap the differences and the terminology:

   !WikiWord: A !WikiWord consists of two or more words run together, also refered to as camel case capitalization. A !WikiWord creates a hyperlink that points to a topic.
   !TopicName: This is the name of a topic as it is displayed in the URL. In most cases this is a !WikiWord, but this is not necessarily the case.
   !TopicTitle: This is a free-form title string that is used as a link text of the !WikiWord pointing to the topic.
   !Wikification: This is the process of deriving a !TopicName from a !TopicTitle when creating, moving or renaming a topic.
                  Wikification will create a proper !WikiWord and optionally transliterate all non-ascci characters. See [[%SYSTEMWEB%.JQueryWikiWord]].
   !WebName: This is the last part of the URL pointing to a topic of a web, just before the !TopicName follows. The !WebName of a nested web thus is specified by
                  the part removing all parent !WebNames as well as the !TopicName of an URL. For example, given a fully quallified web-topic path such as: =Knowledge.Departments.IT.WebHome=, =IT= is the !WebName
   !WebTitle: This is the !TopicTitle of the <nop>%HOMETOPIC% of a web. It will be used when rendering the link text in a breadcrumb of a topic of that web, or whenever refering
                  to the web, i.e. its <nop>%HOMETOPIC%. For example, given the topic =Knowledge.Departments.IT.WebHome= has got the !TopicTitle "IT Knowledgebase", then the link
                  =[<nop>[Knowledge.Departments.IT.WebHome]]= will render as =&lt;a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/Knowledge/Departments/IT/WebHome">IT Knowledgebase&lt;/a>=

---++ Storage of the !TopicTitle

The !TopicTitle is stored in one of these places:

   1 eitehr in a formfield of a !DataForm named "TopicTitle&lt;lang>"
   1 or in a formfield "TopicTitle",
   1 or in a preference setting =TOPICTITLE_&lt;lang>=
   1 or in a preference setting =TOPICTITLE=.

(lang: upper case language code, eg. EN or DE)

If a !DataForm does _not_ have a formfield "TopicTitle" or no !DataForm at all will the !TopicTitle be stored in the preference setting =TOPICTITLE=.
You may change the name of the formfield being used as a !TopicTitle using the =TOPICTITLE_FIELD= preference setting to this topic. For example,
given you specified a !DataForm "SystemForm" with a formfield "SystemName", the set =TOPICTITLE_FIELD= to "SystemName" to store the !TopicTitle in there instead.

Note that in case that the !TopicTitle is identical to its !TopicName no =TOPICTITLE= prefrence will be set.

%JQICON{"fa-warning"}% WARNING: When adding, changing or removing a !DataForm holding a !TopicTitle will it potentially be lost when editing and saving the topic.

---++ Accessing the !TopicTitle

There are multiple ways to read the !TopicTitle:

   * =%<nop>TOPICTITLE%=: expands to the preference setting within a topic
   * =%<nop>FORMFIELD{"TopicTitle"}%=: read the formfield value
   * =%<nop>QUERY{"'%<nop>TOPIC%'/preferences[name='TOPICTITLE'].value"}%=: read the preference setting of a topic

depending on where the !TopicTitle is stored. The most compatible way is to use =%<nop>GETTOPICTITLE{...}%=

| *Parameters* | *Description* | *Default* |
| ="..."= or =topic="..."= | name of the topic to read the title of | current topic |
| =rev="..."= | revision of the topic | latest revision |
| =default="..."= | default string to return in case the topic does not have a !TopicTitle | !TopicName |
| =hideautoinc="on/off"= | boolean to suppress a return value in case the !TopicName matches =...AUTOINC= or =...XXXXXXXXXX= | off |
| =encode="quotes/url/entity/safe"= | encode the result in the given way. See also [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarENCODE]] | |

---++ Perl API

This plugin implements =Foswiki::Func::getTopicTitle($web, $topic, $rev)= for Foswiki versions before 2.2.0. You may also access the
plugin's API directly using =Foswiki::Plugins::TopicTitlePlugin::getTopicTitle(...)=.

This plugin sets the =TopicTitleEnabled= context flag that may be used in wiki applications depending on this feature. See [[%SYSTEMWEB%.IfStatements]]
on how to read the context flags using the =%IF= makro.
